\format{
A named list of length 23, with elements \code{"2000"}, \code{"2001"}, …, \code{"2022"}.
Each yearly element is a list of length 3:
\describe{
\item{\code{Y_ij}}{A numeric matrix \eqn{105 \times 105}. Entry \code{Y_ij[i, j]}
is the count of matches in which player \eqn{i} defeated player \eqn{j}
in that calendar year (nonnegative integer; diagonal is zero).}
\item{\code{N_ij}}{A numeric matrix \eqn{105 \times 105}. Entry \code{N_ij[i, j]}
is the total number of matches between players \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} that year
(nonnegative integer; symmetric by construction; diagonal is zero).}
\item{\code{players_df}}{A tibble/data frame with 105 rows and 7 columns
describing the player index used in the matrices for that year:
\describe{
\item{\code{player}}{Integer player identifier (row/column index used in
\code{Y_ij} and \code{N_ij}).}
\item{\code{worst_rank}}{Worst (numerically largest) ATP ranking attained
by the player during the year.}
\item{\code{median_rank}}{Median ATP ranking across the player's ranking
snapshots in that year.}
\item{\code{last_rank}}{ATP ranking at the last snapshot available in the
year (e.g., year-end ranking).}
\item{\code{age_year}}{Approximate age (in years) for that season (e.g.,
at mid-season).}
\item{\code{ht_year}}{Player height in centimeters (season-level value).}
\item{\code{player_slug}}{Character identifier (URL-safe or underscored
name) for the player.}

\description{
A yearly panel of head-to-head counts for the top 105 ATP players, suitable
for Bradley–Terry/Stochastic Block Model analyses. For each season, the data
include (i) the number of wins by player \eqn{i} against player \eqn{j}
and (ii) the number of matches played between \eqn{i} and \eqn{j}, along
with a per-season player metadata tibble.
}
\details{
The player ordering in \code{players_df} defines the row/column indexing of
\code{Y_ij} and \code{N_ij} for the corresponding year. The diagonal entries of both
matrices are zero by definition. In typical usage for Bradley–Terry-type
models, one can treat \code{Y_ij[i, j]} as the number of “successes” for
\eqn{i} vs. \eqn{j}, with the binomial denominator \code{N_ij[i, j]}.
}
\note{
The matrices may be sparse for many player pairs. Ensure any model code
guards against divisions by zero when \code{N_ij[i, j] = 0}.

\usage{
plot_block_adjacency(
  fit,
  w_ij,
  clean_fun = clean_players_names,
  palette = c(`0` = "#FFFFFF", `1` = "#CDEB8B", `2` = "#78AB46", `3` = "#FFD700", `4` =

}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{Output list from \code{gibbs_BT_SBM()}.}

\item{w_ij}{Integer matrix of wins (same players & order used in \code{fit}).}

\item{clean_fun}{Optional function to prettify player names. Default: identity.}

\item{palette}{Named colors for blocks (as character vector). Defaults to a
Wimbledon-ish palette.}

\item{fill_low, fill_high}{Colors for the heatmap gradient low/high.}

\item{max_n_clust}{Where to filter the mcmc x_t. If not specified we use the modal K}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Plot the adjacency (wins / matches) heatmap with rows/cols ordered by
the hard partition (\code{fit$estimates$x_hat}) and, within blocks,
by marginal wins. Draws block boundary lines and (optionally) a side color strip
for block IDs if \pkg{ggside} is installed.
